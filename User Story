Rotten Cookies User Stories
============================
A tv show search application where we can search tv shows by name genre or other creteria.

### Upon Entering The Page
We are greeted with a welcome message or cookie prompt.
If we denies the cookies, we are redirected away from the page. 

### Top Banner
The log is displayed and we have multiple options to choose from such as the home, top actors, genre, and runtime links. Navigation links.

### Top of Body
The website will have a large carousel that automatically scrolls after a certain time, as well as the ability to navigate left and right by clicking (of the top rated shows from this year).
There may be a log in button as well as other links (about, contact, socials, etc.)

### Scrolling Down
There are several smaller carousels that have show suggestions by genre, run time, language or specific actors, (decades-realese?) etc.
If possible, for a personalized experience, the carousels should adapt to our most frequent actions, such as suggesting movies based on established preferences. 
Once we scroll approximately 1/3 of the way down the page, a 'back to top' button should float.

### Continuing To Scroll
Between at least one of the carousels we see an ad, the X button to close the ad moves, making closing the add frustrating. If we click on the add, we are redirected.

### When We Find A Show
The website will display a 'cookie' rating (including bites taken out for half ratings), and when we hovers hover over the show, a small messsage box appears, showing details of the show.
The website should include a video player for trailers if the API has those links, a shuffle button to suggest movies randomly, and a simple array-based search result feature.

### Bottom Of Page
Will be a footer, including the website logo, repeat links to about, contact, search option buttons & a 'buy me a coffee' link. 

### Hidden Feature
The website should utilize local storage to save information even if I refresh the page.
Overall, the website should have a 'pretty' CSS design, utilize dynamic code and modules, and be linked to APIs for data retrieval. 
As an optional enhancement, it would be great to include authorization for better security 
and incorporate programming slang to find/hide within the code or page for a playful touch."
